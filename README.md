Test Statergy

- I sincerely appreciate the help of **[Anna Royzman](https://twitter.com/QA_nna)** for pairing and explaning me business outcome throughout building the stratergy. She is awesome person who paired me with and understand your emotions and giving right suggestion that works.

## Why do we include tester in planning phase
```
Including tester in planning phase will help to understand about the project/user-story and plan there test activities early and share to team about there approach/scope/chaalenges. 
```

## What we do in Bug Bash ?

```
In software development, a bug bash is a procedure where all the developers, testers, program managers, usability researchers, designers, documentation folks, and even sometimes marketing people, put aside their regular day-to-day duties and "pound on the product".
```
- Who are involved ? People involved are product team members stakeholders only.
- Which environment ? QA Environment
- How much time ? Its last for 30 min to 1 hours.
- Ideally team organise with some food .
- Team will have all major business critical flow predefined and informed to all participant and it must be executed by all participant (This process should consumed only half of the organised time).
- Rest half of the time team can do some exploratory testing and talk about product.
- Common shared google form will be accessible to all participant and where participant write their opinion about the products and bugs they found during above process
- Why Bug bash is done in QA Enviroment ? Team should complete execution of all user story on agreed scope. and team proceed to have a bug bash because team assume there is no continuous change deployed to QA environment and with some amount of testing done.

## What do we do in Bug Triage ?

```
Bug triage is a process where tracker issues are screened and prioritised. Triage should help ensure we appropriately manage all reported issues - bugs as well as improvements and feature 
```
- Bug Triage is a  meeting scheduled by QA, where QA will represent all the bugs together with PO and developer and have a discussion what needs to be fix or not ?


## Why do team have Test Plan ?
```
Test Plan helps team to analysing the high level scope, approach and risks on projects/user story with roughly estimated timelines.
```
## Why do team have Minimum Acceptance Criteria ?

 ```
 1. Minimum Acceptance Criteria helps team to pre-check conditions that a software product must satisfy to be accepted before handing over a new build to QA .
```
## Why do team have Impacted Area ?

```
Impacted Area helps team to figure out risks and shorten the scope of testing in Agile environment.
```
## Why do team have Test Scope defined ?
```
    1.  Test scope must defined based on impacted area + critical business flow + find the existing test (unit test, automated test) what are the risks need to be called out to the team.

    2.  Test scope help team to analyse the test coverage for the new software builds to QA.
 ```

## Why do team have RCA of Bugs ?

```
RCA is a practice to predicated on the belief that problems are best solved by attempting to correct or eliminate root causes by addressing obvious symptoms . By directing corrective measures at root causes, it is hoped that the likelihood of problem reoccurrence will be minimised.
```
## Why do team have Dog Fooding ?

```
Eating your own dog food, also called dog fooding, occurs when an organization uses its own product. This can be a way for an organization to test its products in real-world usage. 
```

## Why do team have Online Monitoring ?
```
         1. Being Critical

         2. Being Safe

         3. Being accessible, Being Protective , Being Accurate and committed

        4. Being Trustable

## Business Outcome : Tester is involved in all phase during SDLC/release cycle that reflects team is being true agile team

- Planning Phase
```
QA is participating in writing and driving Acceptance Criteria for the new story
```
```
Business Goals:  Faster time to market, right feature is delivered to customer.
Risks : No
Outcome : As tester involved from starting phase there is reduce chance for later feedback from tester and rework and it saves cost / time / resources. (Prevention is better than a cure)
```
- Developer Environment:
```
During active development phase, QA is pairing with developer for the pair testing activity (bugs are discovered and fixed without extra paperwork)
```
```
Business goals: Faster development and delivery of the new features, cost of the bug fix is minimal (refer to bug fix costs diagrams). Running MAC in developer environment is good practice where tester is not reworking on blocker/show stopper issue.
Risks:  Developer is not skilled in testing, can miss bugs. Risk is mitigated by point #1 - where QA is defining MAC and thus developer knows everything about what to test.
Outcomes: Bugs are identified faster and fixed right away. QA is learning behavior of new feature because they are involved in story development having a walkthroughs sessions with Dev & PO . Better teamwork.
```
- QA Environment 
```
QA is accountable for verifying that the existing functionality works for release (regression and overall system testing).
```
```
Business goals: faster time to market. Less rework/retest circles. Higher software quality.
Risks: No
Outcomes: QA spends time on the area of their expertise: whole system testing. Better team morale.
```
- UAT :
```
Agile team certify the build is stable and having Dog fooding reduce further risks
```
```
Business Goals : End user to test in UAT environment and provide feedback.
Risks : No
Outcomes:  Reduce last minute surprise at production and align with business/customer expectation(Early customer feedback)
```
- Production :
```
Monitoring in production 
```
```
Business Goals : Being safe and trustable
Risks : No 
Outcomes: Team aware of issues faster rather than customer complaining (Team aware first)
```

## Cost of finding bugs
Diagram of cost of finding bugs in later phase : 

- Critical to metrics shared to team
- Have some learning
- Loss confidence
